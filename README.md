# FMR (Flexible Multi-View Representation Learning for Subspace Clustering)
This is the Matlab implementation of [Flexible Multi-View Representation Learning for Subspace Clustering](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0404.pdf), published in IJCAI 2019.  

## Paper
The main contributions include:
(1) We propose to construct a latent representation by encouraging it to be similar to different views in a weighted way, which implicitly enforces it to encode complementary information from multiple views. \\
(2) We introduce the kernel dependence measure: HilbertSchmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), to capture high-order, non-linear relationships among different views, which benefits recovering underlying cluster structure of data.
